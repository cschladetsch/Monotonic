Monotonic
=========

Fastest C++ Allocator.

This library provides the fastest way to manage memory in a C++ application. Yes, that is a bold claim. See the exhaustive results http://github.com/cschladetsch/Monotonic/tree/master/libs/monotonic/test/results/ 

There are no source files - to add Monotonic functionality to your project, simply get latest and add the root folder to your include path.

To use, see /libs/monotonic/test/monotonic.sln.

For performance analysis, see the monotonic project in the solution. 

For unit-tests, see the monotonic_tests project in the solution.

Tried and tested on Win7, Win8, Ubuntu and OS/X.
